CLASS 13(5th Nov, Tuesday):

Hashing:
- Introduction
- Direct Access Table
- Collision Handling
  --Chaining
  --Open Addressing (Linear probing, Quadratic probing, Double hashing)
  --Major differences between chaining and open addressing
- Load factor
- Rehashing

Implementation in STL:
- map
- unordered_map

Problems:
- Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, search and getRandom in constant time
- Find whether an array is subset of another array
- Minimum delete operations to make all elements of array same
- 2 Sum
- Largest Continuous Sequence Zero Sum
- Given a binary array find the largest subarray such that:
  - Number of zeros equals to the number of ones
  - Number of ones is one more than the number of zeros
- Anagrams
