CLASS 11(21st Oct, Monday):

Heaps:
- Motivation for heaps
- Complete binary tree
- Heap order property
- Insertion => O(logn)
- Build heap => O(n)
- Proof of build heap time complexity
- Deletion => O(logn)
- Heapify => O(logn)
- Implementation 

Priority queues

priority_queue in STL
- Default (max heap ordering)
- User defined (using functors to set priority)
