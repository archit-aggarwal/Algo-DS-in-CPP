CLASS 4 (4th Sep, Wednesday):

Time and space complexity analysis
- Why do we need it
- How to compare two algos that may run on different/same machines 
- Asymptotic analysis
  - Best, Average and worst case
- Asymptotic Notations (theta, big O, big omega, little o, little omega)
- Tight and loose bounds

Analyzing loops
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(m*n)
- O(m+n)
- O(n^c)
- O(loglogn)

Analyzing and solving recurrences:
- Substitution method
- Recursion tree method

Divide and conquer algorithms:
- General idea
- Merge sort
  - How it works
  - Code
  - Time complexity : O(nlogn)
  - Recursion tree
