CLASS 1 (27th Aug, Tuesday):

Pseudocode
- 1 based indexing
- No curly braces 
- No declaration (int, char etc.)
- Assignment operator (= or <- can be used)

Space and Time complexity analysis

Linear search algorithm --- O(n)
Jump search algorithm --- O(sqrt(n))
Binary search algorithm --- O(log(n))

CPP helper functions:
binary_search -> return t/f whether ele is present in the array or not
lower_bound -> returns pos of 1st occ of ele if present else pos of next higher ele
upper_bound -> returns pos of next higher ele regardless of ele is present or not 

Questions (easy to hard):
Square root of an integer
Number of elements smaller than a number in a sorted array
Find the pivot element in a rotated sorted array
Search an element in a rotated sorted array
Matrix search problems:
-When all rows are sorted
-When all rows and columns are sorted
-When all rows are sorted and last ele of every row is smaller than first ele of next row
Painter's partition problem, Allocate books problem, Robots problem
Median of two sorted arrays
Matrix median (when all rows are sorted)
