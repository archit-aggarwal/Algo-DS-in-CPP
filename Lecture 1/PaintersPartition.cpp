/*
    Question: 
    You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. 
    There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. 
    You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the following constraints:
    - 2 painters cannot share a board to paint.
    - A painter will only paint contiguous boards.
    Eg. 
    K : 2
    T : 5
    L : [1, 10]
    output = The minimum time required is 50
